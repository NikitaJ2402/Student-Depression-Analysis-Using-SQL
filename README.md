This project explores the relationship between various factors (e.g., gender, course of study, academic year, marital status, and more) and the presence of depression among students. Using SQL for exploratory data analysis (EDA), the goal is to identify patterns, trends, and correlations within the data to better understand the mental health landscape in an academic setting.

Objectives : 
1. Analyze the prevalence of depression among students based on demographic and academic factors.
2. Identify key factors influencing students' mental health.
3. Provide insights for stakeholders to develop targeted interventions for student well-being.

The dataset contains information about students, including their mental health status and factors such as:
1.Gender
2.Academic course
3.Year of study
4.Marital status
5.Other relevant details

Methodology :
Data cleaning and preprocessing using SQL.
Descriptive analysis to summarize key statistics.
Comparative analysis across different demographic groups.
Insights derived from SQL queries and visualizations.
Outcomes
The project provides actionable insights to help educational institutions address mental health challenges and foster supportive environments for students.
